# Interactive Computer Graphics Algorithms

This repository contains the implementation of the algorithms presented during the discipline of computer graphics, taught in the computer science course.

They were implemented using javascript and the [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) library. Through an interactive grid, the user can select the desired algorithm and view its output.

## Extra Work

The `extra` folder contains the implementation of a 3D scene using the [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) library, also for javascript. This scene presents basic concepts of: rendering, shadow and lighting, import of ready models, textures and control of vision and movement.
